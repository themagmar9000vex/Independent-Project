# Independent-Project
This project simulates a Pokemon Battle with Java. The Game file is the main file that oncec run starts the Pokemon Battle. The Pokemon Class in the Pokemon file represents the 
parent class for all the specific types of Pokemon. This class contains all the similiar features, such as Health, types, list of moves, etc. The multitude of specific pokemon 
files (Charizard, Venasaur, etc.) contains the subclasses for each of these pokemon and the information needed to use them in battle. The RNG file handles all of the random
elements of the game. The UserSelection file handles the selection of the moves by the User for their pokemon.
